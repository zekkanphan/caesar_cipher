# caesar_cipher

## About
The aim of this project was to create a program--in ruby--that will generate an encrpyted version messages that are passed into the function. The user can either pass string and number arguments directly into the function; if they don't the program will prompt the user for a message and a number that they want to shift their message by. To test out this cipher, please fork the repository and open the code with any code editor.
